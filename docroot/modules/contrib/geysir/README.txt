INTRODUCTION
------------

Geysir introduces several user interface optimisations which support content
authors in their daily workflow. Initially, focus lies on the page building
process: Geysir depends on the excellent Paragraphs module and currently
supports the following features:

 * Editing of separate paragraphs in a modal dialog
 * Deletion of separate paragraphs from the front-end

When editing page content, the modal interface reduces the need for authors
to switch to the Drupal backend constantly. Furthermore, there is no more need
to dig around in the backend to find the correct paragraph to edit, as Geysir
provides controls for editing and deletion per paragraph straight from
the front-end.

These powerful features can greatly speed up the work of content authors and
make their workflow more intuitive.
