ABOUT
Provides integration with bLazy to lazy load and multi-serve images to save
bandwidth and server requests. The user will have faster load times and save
data usage if they don't browse the whole page.


FEATURES
o Supports core Image.
o Supports core Responsive image.
o Supports Colorbox/Photobox/ PhotoSwipe, also multimedia lightboxes.
o Multi-serving images for configurable breakpoints, almost similar to core
  Responsive image, only less complex.
o CSS background lazyloading, see Mason, GridStack, and Slick carousel.
o IFRAME urls via custom coded, Blazy Media with core Media and oEmbed.
o Supports inline images and iframes with lightboxes, and grid or CSS3 masonry
  via Blazy Filter.
o Delay loading for below-fold images until 100px (configurable) before they are
  visible at viewport.
o A simple effortless CSS loading indicator.
o It doesn't take over all images, so it can be enabled as needed via Blazy
  formatter, or its supporting modules.


OPTIONAL FEATURES
o Views fields for File ER and Media Entity integration, see Slick Browser.
o Views style plugin Blazy Grid.
o Field formatters: Blazy, Blazy Video, and Blazy Image with Media integration.


REQUIREMENTS
- bLazy library:
  o Download bLazy from https://github.com/dinbror/blazy
  o Extract it as is, rename "blazy-master" to "blazy", so the assets are at:

    /libraries/blazy/blazy.min.js


INSTALLATION
  1. MANUAL:
  Install the module as usual, more info can be found on:
  https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules

  2 COMPOSER:
  There are various ways to install third party bower/npm asset libraries. Check
  out any below suitable to your workflow:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/blazy/issues/3021902
  https://www.drupal.org/project/slick/issues/2907371
  Or jump here:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/slick/issues/2907371#comment-12882235

  It is up to you to decide which works best. Composer is not designed to manage
  JS, CSS or HTML framework assets. It is for PHP. Then come Composer plugins,
  and other workarounds to make Composer workflow easier. As many alternatives,
  it is not covered here. Please find more info on the above-mentioned issues.


USAGES
Be sure to enable Blazy UI which can be uninstalled at production later.
o Go to Manage display page, e.g.:
  /admin/structure/types/manage/page/display

o Find "Blazy" formatter under "Manage display".

o Go to "/admin/config/media/blazy" to manage few global options, including
  enabling support for lazyloading core Responsive image.


MODULES THAT INTEGRATE WITH OR REQUIRE BLAZY
o Blazy PhotoSwipe
o GridStack
o Intense
o Mason
o Slick (D8 only by now)
o Slick Views (D8 only by now)
o Slick Media
o Slick Video
o Slick Browser

Most duplication efforts from the above modules will be merged into
\Drupal\blazy\Dejavu namespace.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Resizing is not supported. Just reload the page.

VIEWS INTEGRATION
Blazy provides two simple Views fields for File ER, and Media Entity.

When using Blazy formatter within Views, check "Use field template" under
  "Style settings", if trouble with Blazy Formatter as stand alone Views output.
  On the contrary, uncheck "Use field template", when Blazy formatter
  is embedded inside another module such as GridStack so to pass the renderable
  array accordingly.
  This is a Views common gotcha with field formatter, so be aware of it.
  This confusion should be solved later when Blazy formatter is aware of Views.

MIN-WIDTH
If the images appear to be shrinked within a floating container, add
  some expected width or min-width to the parent container via CSS accordingly.
  Non-floating image parent containers aren't affected.

MIN-HEIGHT
Add a min-height CSS to individual element to avoid layout reflow if not using
  Aspect ratio or when Aspect ratio is not supported such as with Responsive
  image. Otherwise some collapsed images containers will defeat the purpose of
  lazyloading. When using CSS background, the container may also be collapsed.
  Both layout reflow and lazyloading delay issues are actually taken care of
  if Aspect ratio option is enabled in the first place.

Adjust, and override blazy CSS files accordingly.


ROADMAP/ TODO
[x] Adds a basic configuration to load the library, probably an image formatter.
    2/24/2016
[x] Media entity image/video, and Video embed field lazyloading, if any.
    10/25/2016
    Added both simple Blazy Media formatter and Views field Media Entity.
[x] Makes a solid lazyloading solution for IMG, DIV, IFRAME tags.
    4/9/2017
    Added IFRAME (Blazy Video), apart from existing IMG/ DIV (CSS background).


CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS
A full release should be reasonable after proper feedbacks from the community,
some code cleanup, and optimization where needed. Patches are very much welcome.

Alpha, Beta, DEV releases are for developers only. Beware of possible breakage.


UPDATE SOP:
Visit any of the following URLs when updating Blazy, or its related modules.
Please ignore any documentation if already aware of Drupal site building. This
is for the sake of completed documentation for those who may need it.

1. /admin/config/development/performance
  Unless an update is required, clearing cache should fix most issues.

  o Hit "Clear all caches" button once the new Blazy in place.
  o Regenerate CSS and JS as the latest fixes may contain changes to the assets.
    Ignore below if you are aware, and found no asset changes from commits.
    Normally clearing cache suffices when no asset changes are found.
    - Uncheck CSS and JS aggregation options under Bandwidth optimization.
    - Save.
    - [Ignorable] See one of Blazy related pages if display is expected.
    - [Ignorable] Only clear cache if needed.
    - Check both options again.
    - Save again.
    - [Ignorable] Press F5, or CMD/ CTRL + R to refresh browser cache if needed.

2. /admin/reports/status
  Check for any pending update, and run /update.php from the brower address bar.

3. If Twig templates are customized, compare against the latest.


PROGRAMATICALLY
See blazy.api.php for details.

PERFORMANCE TIPS:
o If breakpoints provided with tons of images, using image styles with ANY crop
  is recommended to avoid image dimension calculation with individual images.
  The image dimensions will be set once, and inherited by all images as long as
  they contain word crop. If using scaled image styles, regular calculation
  applies.

SUBMITTING PATCHES OR ISSUES
Please consider the following to help you explain better, and to help us
understand better your bug reports, or patches as needed:
https://www.drupal.org/issue-summaries
https://www.drupal.org/node/1326662

o If you hate formalism, consider a crystal clear line, or two in the body text.
o Avoid explaining everything in the title.
o Use body text for explanation purposes.
o If language is a barrier, use google translate, or alike.

1. SUBMITTING ISSUES
When submitting bug reports, please:
o be kind with proper reproduction, and enough details.
o mention library version, related-module version, if any, active theme, or
  anything which may help us identify issue better.
o ensure the library is loaded, not 404.
o switch to stock Bartik for just in case it is your custom theme.
o use matching or similar branches or tags for related modules.
o check out dups.
o file it a support request, if unsure. We'll mark a bug a bug even if you
  file it under support requests.

2. SUBMITTING PATCHES
We consider a patch as help, they consider it a sale, so thank you in advanced!
In order for you to help, or buy, us successfully, please consider:
o communicating and filling out the body text with proper explanations, not in
  comments (unless for comment patches, of course).
  I've seen patches which broke a module, so explanation is a must.
  If you have no time to write it in the body text, please hold off till later!
o providing optional links to the change records, or docs, if any.
o providing links to docs is a must for coding standards issues.
  This also lets us, you and me, learn from the actual docs, not told by tools!
  We can just run `drupalcs ...`, but help is welcome, too, in case a miss.
o checking out the latest dev branch in case already resolved.
o providing reproduction steps for bug reports is a must. No repro, no bugs.

You must speak like human to human, and help us respect you, and your time.
Dumping patches with empty body text will be disregarded, till the above is met.

Thank you for your kind consideration, cooperation, and contribution!
