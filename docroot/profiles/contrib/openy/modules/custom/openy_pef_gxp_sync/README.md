### OpenY PEF GXP Sync

Synchronizes GroupEx schedules to PEF.

### Quick start

#### Configure OpenY GXP module

Go to `/admin/openy/integrations/groupex-pro/gxp`.

1. Set up your GroupExPro client id.
2. Provide parent activity ID. Should be Group Exercises under Fitness.

#### How to sync my groupex data to my project?

Run `drush openy-pef-gxp-sync` command from your project docroot.

### How the syncer works

The syncer consists of the next steps:

  1. Fetcher - fetches data from GroupEx API.
  2. Wrapper - processes the data for saving (maps location ids, fixes title encoding problems, etc).
  3. Wrapper - groups all items by Class ID and Location ID, calculates hashes.
  4. Wrapper - prepares data to be removed (extra items in DB or changed hashes)
  5. Wrapper - prepares data to be created (new items + changed hashes)
  6. Cleaner - removes data to be removed.
  7. Saver   - creates data to be created.

### How the syncer works in details (for developers)

#### Adding & Removing locations.

1. If a location is removed in API it should be removed in DB.
2. If a location is added in API it should be added (with classes) in DB.
3. If a class is removed in API it should be removed in DB (with all class items);
3. If a class is added in API it should be added in DB (with all class items);

#### Updating classes.

1. Each GroupEx class can have several class items (with the same class ID).
2. We compare hashes for Location ID + Class ID + all class items inside (on unprocessed data!).
3. If hash is changed we should remove all items belongs to this hash and create them again.

### How to debug

1. To emulate API data please use `FetcherDebuggerClass`. Just replace `@openy_pef_gxp_sync.fetcher` with
`@openy_pef_gxp_sync.fetcher_debugger` to emulate API response.

2. Use `DEBUG_MODE` constants inside classes to debug specific service.

### Known issues in sync.

1. There is an issue if class in Groupex has category set to "General" - it will not be synced and displayed at PEF.
