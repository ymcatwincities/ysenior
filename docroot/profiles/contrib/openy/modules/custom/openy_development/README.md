### Welcome to Open Y Continuous Integration module

This module aims to help with Continuous Integration for the Open Y distribution.
Initially module used for enabling domains with different theme(design) per domain.

Example:
 - openy.cibox.tools/buildXXX shows Rose theme as default for the site and Seven for admin interface
 - lily.openy.cibox.tools/buildXXX shows Lily theme as default for the site and Seven for admin interface
