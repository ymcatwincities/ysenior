### User Instruction
There were added 2 fields to the content type:

 - Pages
 - Alert Visibility State
 
If user leave Pages field empty - This alert will be shown on all pages.
If user set some patterns to the field Pages, he can have 2 variants of behavior:

Show only on the pages which were imputed (Include state for field Alert Visibility State)
Disable only on the pages which were imputed (Exclude state for field Alert Visibility State)

The rules for pattern are the common for the all Drupal site and work as for Visibility rules for blocks.
